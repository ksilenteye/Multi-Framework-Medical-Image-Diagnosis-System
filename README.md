# Multi-Framework-Medical-Image-Diagnosis-System
The Multi-Framework Medical Image Diagnosis System is an intelligent diagnostic platform designed to detect and classify diseases from medical images such as X-rays.


It integrates TensorFlow for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based feature extraction,
PyTorch for fine-tuning transformer-based vision models (like ViT or Swin Transformer), and
scikit-learn for meta-learning ensemble techniques that combine both models’ outputs for
enhanced accuracy.
This project demonstrates a cross-framework ensemble pipeline and can be deployed as a
clinical decision support tool that assists radiologists in faster and more accurate disease
detection.
